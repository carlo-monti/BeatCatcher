# DrumBeatFollower
This project is the implementation of the B-Keeper beat tracking algorithm to an Arduino compatible device. The algorithm has been described here: Robertson, Andrew, and Mark D. Plumbley. “Synchronizing Sequencing Software to a Live Drummer.” Computer Music Journal, vol. 37, no. 2, 2013, pp. 46–60. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/24265466. Accessed 27 Jul. 2022.). It basically takes two input signals from a drum-kit (kick and snare) and outputs a MIDI Clock synchronized with the groove.
